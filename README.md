# ProgrammingB

My submission for Assignment B of the Programming & Data Structures module from 1st year of university.

The program is a C# Windows Forms application. It is a childrens dice game involving rolling a number of dice and getting points for having the same number on several dice.

The program also features a computer player, profiles, stats etc.
